/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe your artistic creation and how you went about writing a program
 *  to produce it. If you found information about a fractal from somewhere
 *  (such as the course textbook, the booksite, or another offline or online
 *  source) cite it here.
 ******************************************************************************/

I love fractal trees, so I just wanted to do one.
It is very popular, no need to cite anything.


/******************************************************************************
 *  To get full credit on your Art.java, you need to have at least 3
 *  functions, including main(). Please list these functions below:
 ******************************************************************************/

 1. public static void main(String[] args)
 2. private static void picker(int idx)
 3. private static void doArt(int n, double x, double y, double angle)



/******************************************************************************
 *  To get full credit on your Art.java, you need to have used at least
 *  two of the criteria below. Please put an 'X' in the checkbox of the
 *   criteria that your submission fulfills, for instance:
 *     [ ] this is an unchecked criteria
 *     [X] this is a checked criteria
 ******************************************************************************/

    [ ] call one or more Transform2D method

    [X] use different parameters than our examples: f(n, x, y, size)

    [X] use different StdDraw methods than in examples (e.g.,
        ellipses, arcs, text)

    [ ] number of recursive calls not constant per level (e.g.,
        conditional recursion)

    [ ] mutually recursive methods

    [ ] multiple recursive methods

    [ ] doesn't always recur from level n to level n-1

    [ ] draw between recursive calls, not just before/after all
        recursive calls

    [X] use recursive level for secondary purpose (e.g., level
        dictates color)


/******************************************************************************
 *  Please check the following box if you do not want your Art to be shared
 *  (anonymously) with the rest of the class.
 ******************************************************************************/

    [ ] I do *NOT* want my art to be shared with the class.
