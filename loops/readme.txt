 *  What is the relationship between the number of steps n of the random walk
 *  and the mean squared distance? By "relationship," we mean something like:
 *
 *      mean squared distance = 126 n^9
 *
 *  Briefly justify your answer based on computational experiments.
 *  Describe the experiments and list several data points.

mean squared distance = n

By increasing the number of trials, the mean squared distance approaches n.

n = 100
trials = 100000

mean squared distance = 100.38298

n = 100
trials = 100000

mean squared distance = 100.32612


n = 100
trials = 100000

mean squared distance = 100.12804


n = 100
trials = 100000

mean squared distance = 100.2252


######

n = 10
trials = 1000

mean squared distance = 9.82

n = 10
trials = 1000

mean squared distance = 9.634


n = 10
trials = 1000

mean squared distance = 10.482
